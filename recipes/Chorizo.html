        <img src="../pictures/recipe3.webp">
        <p>The flavor of this spicy chorizo queso dip definitely sets it apart from the rest. Great for a party or when you can't figure out what to do with a roll of bulk chorizo sausage! It reheats well.</p>
   <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 ounces bulk chorizo sausage</li>

        <li>1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as Rotel), drained</li>

        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed</li>

        <li>1 (8 ounce) package processed cheese (such as Velveeta), cubed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chorizo in the hot skillet until well browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain well and transfer to a slow cooker.
        
        Add diced tomatoes with chiles, cream cheese, and processed cheese to slow cooker; stir well. Cover and cook on Low until cheese has melted, stirring occasionally, about 1 Â½ to 2 hours.
