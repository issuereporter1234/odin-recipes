            <h1>Real N'awlins Muffuletta</h1>
            <img class="image" src="../pictures/recipe2.webp">
            <p>A genuine muffuletta should be made on oven-fresh round Italian bread loves topped with sesame seeds. The spicy, tangy olive salad is what really sets this meat and cheese sandwich apart. These gigantic sandwiches were invented a century ago at Sicilian Deli here in New Orleans. Be sure to use high-quality ingredients as it really makes a difference!

                The muffuletta, the classic New Orleans sandwich, is surprisingly easy to make at home. This muffuletta recipe — complete with flavorful cold cuts, sliced cheese, and homemade olive spread — is authentically delicious.
                
                What Is a Muffuletta?
                A muffuletta is both a type of sandwich invented by Italian immigrants in New Orleans and the type of bread it's served on. A muffuletta consists of a halved muffuletta loaf with deli meats (usually salami, ham, and mortadella) and olive spread. The large sandwich is cut into quarters, so one loaf of bread produces at least four servings.

                This traditional muffuletta is made with genoa salami, mortadella, and sliced cooked ham.
                
                What Else Will You Need?
                Muffulettas are made with Italian bread (use store-bought or make your own), cheese mozzarella and provolone) and olive salad. For the homemade olive salad, you'll need: green and kalamata olives, pepperoncini, pickled cauliflower, cocktail onions, garlic, capers, celery, carrots, spices, olive oil, canola oil, and red wine vinegar.
                
                How to Make a Muffuletta at Home
                You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make muffulettas at home: Make the olive salad, assemble the sandwiches, and cut into quarters. If you have time, let the muffulettas sit in the fridge for an hour or two to allow the flavors to meld and the olive juice to soak into the bread.
                
                Recipe Tip
                Since you're going to all the trouble of making the olive salad, consider doubling the recipe so you'll have some extra waiting around for when you get another muffuletta craving — it keeps for at least a month.

                "Perfect," raves GoldenEye. "Exactly like having muffuletta in New Orleans! It was so good and I made another one the next week!"
                
                "This is awesome," according to Kelli H. "Great flavor and texture. Best the second day. If I'm going to eat it the same day, I make it in the a.m. and let it soak up the dressing all day. Definitely a must-have in my recipe box!"

                <p>To make the olive salad: Roughly chop together green olives, Kalamata olives, pepperoncini, cauliflower, cocktail onions, garlic, capers, celery, and carrot.

                    Combine with oregano, basil, black pepper, and celery seed in a medium bowl. Add in olive oil, canola oil, and vinegar. Mix together and transfer the mixture into a glass jar (or other nonreactive container). Pour in more oil to cover if needed.

                    To make the sandwiches: Cut loaves of bread in half horizontally; hollow out some of the excess bread to make room for filling.
